# Bandle-Game

My recreation of the popular game Bandle! Built using TypeScript, React, Python FastAPI and the Demucs Music Source Separation AI Model.

## Instructions

<p style={{margin: "30px"}}>Guess the correct song by listening to different instrument tracks! </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The game randomly selects a song, but you wonâ€™t know which one.</li>
              <li>The first round starts with just the drums playing.</li>
              <li>With each incorrect guess, a new instrument is added.</li>
              <li>After listening, type your guess in the search box and submit it.</li>
              <li>If your guess is correct, you win! ðŸŽ‰</li>
              <li>If you reach the final round and still guess incorrectly, game over!</li>
            </ul>

## Current future plans
- Youtube API to scrape data and provide hints to user (similar to actual Bandle site)
- Allow user to add their own song and the app would process it and then allow them to play an instance with the song being their game?
